# EasyTodos
A basic showcase of Android Architecture Components, Dagger2  and Firebase (Screenshots at the end).

# Features
- Online/offline funtionallity with Firebase and Room
- Architecture components have been used (MVVM)
- Dagger2 for dependency injection
- The whole application has been writen with Kotlin

# Future Features?
- Add testing to the components
- Add a better UI
- Add task groups (work, home, personal...)

# Notes and comments
This app is just a showcase of the Android architecture components, the implementation is not the best as it is the first time I have used MVVM and maybe the code is not as well writen as I would like to. 

Other than that if this application helps you in any way, or you are looking for some advice or want to leave some positive critism, you can send me a message at my twitter @androidciudadan or you can email me at ingjorgegomez@outlook.com
